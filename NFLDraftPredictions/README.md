Group Project for CMSE202

Predicting NFL Draft Order Based on College Performance and Physical Attributes

by AJ Bensman,  Burke Dugan,  Ethan Pritchard,  Bruce Smith, Jay Stansberry, and Han Sullivan

## How the code should be run

There are two jupyter notebook files that contain all our code: clean_and_merge_data.ipynb and Combined_Analysis.ipynb.

clean_and_merge_data.ipynb does not need to be run as all files are saved in the repo and submitted, but it can be if you are unable to find some of the csv files.

Combined_Analysis.ipynb contains all data analysis and can be run after installing the necessary packages, such as wordcloud.
