### Authored by: Bruce Smith, AJ Bensman, Burke Dugan, Ethan Pritchard, Jay Stansberry, and Han Sullivan

Welcome to the NFL Draft Order Prediction project! In this machine learning project, we explore the exciting world of sports analytics by leveraging various techniques to predict the NFL draft order based on college player statistics. Our goal is to build predictive models that assist teams in identifying potential top draft picks.

## Introduction

The NFL Draft is a pivotal event where teams select players from college programs to join their professional ranks. Our project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict the order in which players will be drafted based on their college performance metrics.

## Features

- Utilization of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Multiple Regression for predictive modeling.
- Handling of diverse college player statistics as input features, including yards gained, touchdowns scored, interceptions, and more.
- Implementation of data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and standardize the dataset.
- Exploration of dimensionality reduction using PCA to extract key features and reduce multicollinearity.
- Comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate prediction models.

## Data

The dataset used in this project comprises comprehensive college player statistics gathered over multiple seasons. These statistics include passing, rushing, receiving, and defensive performance metrics. The dataset is obtained from reputable sources and meticulously cleaned to ensure accuracy.

## Methods

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is carefully preprocessed, involving handling of missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing features.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining relevant information, enhancing model performance and interpretability.

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** We leverage SVM to classify players based on their college statistics and predict their draft order. Hyperparameter tuning is performed for optimal results.

4. **Multinomial Logistic Regression:** Multinomial logistic regression is applied to predict the draft round in which players are likely to be selected.

5. **Multiple Regression:** We use multiple regression to estimate the projected draft position of players based on their college performance.

## Results

The project's success is evaluated based on the accuracy of the prediction models, precision-recall metrics, and comparative analysis of different algorithms. We present our findings and insights regarding the predictive power of each technique.
